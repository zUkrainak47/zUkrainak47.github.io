### This calculator will tell you how many more wishes you will need to guarantee any combination of 5-star characters and weapons based on your pity, primogems etc.
### You will also be presented a graph showing the probabilities for lower amounts of additional wishes, the odds are calculated based on all possible 50/50 wins/losses combinations.
### There's also support for a 2nd account just in case you need that. You can enable that as well as tweak some other parameters in the settings!
### Everything is backed up in your browser locally as well, so you won't have to input all of your data every time.
